If your [commit message sucks][suck], I'm not going to accept your pull
request.  I've explained very politely dozens of times that [my general
guidelines][guidelines] are absolute rules on my own repositories, so I may
lack the energy to explain it to you yet another time.  And please, if I ask
you to change something, `git commit --amend` and `git push -f`.

If a feature idea is nontrivial, you should probably open an issue to [discuss
it][] before attempting a pull request.  One of the biggest challenges in
maintaining rails.vim has been beating back the bloat, so do not assume that
your idea will make the cut.  And if I like your idea, I'm generally amenable
to just knocking it out myself, rather than making you familiarize yourself
with a 4 thousand line code base.
